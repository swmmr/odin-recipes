        <h2>What is Tteokbokki?</h2>
        <p>Tteokbokki, a quintessential Korean street food, consists of chewy rice cakes simmered in a spicy and sweet 
            gochujang-based sauce. This dish is renowned for its vibrant red color and rich, complex flavors. It typically 
            includes ingredients like fish cakes, boiled eggs, and occasionally vegetables such as cabbage or scallions, 
            adding layers of texture and taste. Tteokbokki's popularity stems from its comforting warmth and addictive 
            combination of spicy, sweet, and savory notes, making it a beloved choice for both casual snacking and hearty 
            meals across South Korea.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Main</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>350g korean rice cakes</li>
            <li>150g korean fish cakes</li>
            <li>2 cups korean soup stock</li>
            <li>60g thin sliced onions</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Sauce</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 Tbsp gochuhang</li>
            <li>1 1/2 Tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tsp minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 tsp gochugaru</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>garnish</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tsp roasted sesame seeds</li>
            <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 stalk of finely chopped green onion</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the rice cakes in warm water for 10 minutes. (If you are using fresh rice cakes that 
                are already tender, feel free to skip this step. However, if you are using packaged rice cakes 
                from the fridge, it is recommended to soak them to enhance their moisture level before proceeding 
                with the recipe.)</li>
            <li>Boil the soup stock in a shallow pot over medium high heat and dissolve the tteokbokki sauce by 
                stirring it with a spatula. Once the seasoned stock is boiling, add the rice cakes, fish cakes and 
                onion. Boil them a further 3 to 5 mins until the rice cakes are fully cooked.  Then, to thicken the 
                sauce and to deepen the flavor, simmer it over low heat for a further 2 to 4 mins.</li>
            <li>Add the sesame oil, sesame seeds, and green onion then quickly stir. Serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Additonal Notes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Leftover tteokbokki can be refrigerated for a day or two</li>
            <li>When reheating, add some spare soup stock or water. Though it wonâ€™t be as saucy as the first time</li>
        </ul>
